## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles:
1. **Incremental Changes**: Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality
3. **Test-Driven**: Validate each change with historical data
4. **Risk-First**: Prioritize capital protection over profit optimization
5. **Documentation**: Document all changes and decisions

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Each new function
- **Integration Tests**: Data flow validation
- **Backtesting**: Historical performance validation
- **Paper Trading**: Live prediction validation

### Success Metrics:
- **Phase 1**: Prediction stability (signals change <10% daily)
- **Phase 2**: Improved accuracy (>60% winning predictions)
- **Phase 3**: Positive backtested returns (>15% annual)
- **Phase 4**: Controlled risk (max drawdown <10%)
- **Phase 5**: Fundamental correlation (growth stocks outperform)
